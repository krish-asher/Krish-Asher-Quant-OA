It\u2019s one of the less useful STEM degrees to have for quant finance in my opinion.\n\nThe key skills are: statistical skills, data modelling skills, and both require underlying mathematical skills as well. Most other STEM degrees provide more in-depth statistical and mathematical explorations, as well as modelling skills which has its route in statistics not computer science anyway. Machine learning perhaps comp sci has an advantage over, but most other stem degrees will still have opportunities to learn that be it as electives or as a major etc."

Faculty Advisors are highly recommended to oversee each school\u2019s participation, i.e. you can't just show up and be like \"uh yea we go to waterloo so we represent waterloo\". You need to coordinate with your school. If your school is  already a registered participant in the competition then thats because they already have a team, one that probably won't be trivial to just show up and steal someone's place.\n\nOptiver ready go is only open to students in Australia and New Zealand who have no relevant  work experience.\n\nCitadel Data Open has over 10k applicants per year.\n\nSo on and so forth.",

But even among the profitable companies, rumors are at some places, the comp just doesn't get distributed well. Here's what I've heard 2nd hand from friends, but it's definitely not a complete list of highly profitable firms. For profitability, citsec optiver are clearly top in options. In HFT, jump and tower from silo side, HRT, XTX, headlands. In general prop, jane street, radix. In hedge funds, de shaw, pdt. In multi manager hedge funds, citadel gqs, millenium seem to have the best reputation.

                    "Missing birthday parties for brain teasers? LMAO what? Yes brainteasers are a grind but this just sounds so dramatic. I grinded brain teasers like crazy for one year - Yes I woke up early on saturdays, I met with friends at cafe's to prep on Sundays. I tried to fit it in after classes most evenings. But this just sounds a little extreme. You can accumulate countless hours at brain teasers without having to throw your personal life out of the window. Almost anyone who plays video games could just replace gaming time with brain teaser time and they'd get good pretty quick.\n\nThe \"I'm a bad person\" seems extremely dramatic. Yes, you're making rich people richer, but you're also making rich people richer at the expense of other rich people. It's like playing a fun video game.\n\nThe problems aren't interesting? WHAT!? Quantitative finance is one of the most stimulating fields around. Aside from research labs at FAANG companies, there are very few jobs where you get to do academic-esque research and get paid a ton for it. Not to mention the field is full of fascinating computational problems and you get access to incredible data-sets and computational tools. You get to work alongside BRILLIANT and INCREDIBLE people. Some of the best parts of the industry are the incredible conversations you have with colleagues. The field attracts people who have boundless energy and curiosity.

                    "This is something someone with actual experience should be providing advice on, not a new hire.\n\n1. Recruiting is brutal\n\nYes, it\u2019s highly competitive, but not as brutal as you make it out to be. Did you ever consider that if it took 3 years at the expense of everything else in your life, that perhaps you\u2019re not cut out for it? That\u2019s not to say you\u2019re not smart etc, but quant finance usually uses people with a more theoretical background, where many other STEM jobs usually hire someone with a practical background. So questions tend to be focused on that side. If you did comp sci or engineering, you learn the theoretical part, but you\u2019re applying it to certain things. Perhaps your skills lean more that way?\n\nAlso, did you ever consider that you\u2019re burned out due to the prep and not the work? Most people are recommended to take a bit of a break in between studying/applications and work so as to avoid this. Alternatively, did you consider the fact that you \u201coverfit\u201d your skills with regards to interviews rather then the actual skills required? It seems like both are the case here that would cause the issues you\u2019re seeing, which are also explained by the firm you\u2019re at which I\u2019ll get to.\n\nAlso, burnout isn\u2019t as significant as you suggest. People will usually spend maybe a few years rather then a whole career, sure. But they don\u2019t burnout as fast as you suggest. It could be a firm issue, but it seems to me like you\u2019re not truly qualified for the position. Considering it took you so long and so much effort to break in, I\u2019m willing to bet this is a huge part of the case.\n\nLuck does play a part too, yes, but completely. Everyone who makes final rounds is good enough, but you might have 100 people in the final and only 1 gets the role. Often on the recruiters side, it\u2019s hard to know the applicants well enough to chose who\u2019s best, so at that point is roughly pot luck. But to get there relies more on talent/skill. There\u2019s a luck aspect, but same with exams, luck won\u2019t make a huge difference in the grand scheme (excluding final rounds).\n\n2. Citadel sucks\n\nYeah it does, but it doesn\u2019t mean all firms suck which you touch on.\n\n3. We\u2019re bad\n\nYou\u2019re arguments rely on one simple assumption: you\u2019re making money for the rich which is immoral. I agree with everything you draw on assuming that, but I disagree with this assumption. Firstly, we\u2019re making money for investors who tend to be wealthier. I\u2019d argue 3 things based on this; making money for investors is not immoral as it has wide reaching benefits, nearly every professional works for large company and thus who are we different to them (as a result, what\u2019s good vs bad changes), and lastly how is making money for the rich immoral according to any ethical theories? It\u2019s a popular assumption because everyone agrees with it for various reasons, some are valid, but most are simply justifications for a predetermined belief simply because they don\u2019t like the rich. If you have decent argument, I\u2019d change my mind on this since I don\u2019t firmly believe one way or the other. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as black/white as people make it out to be.\n\n4. Problems aren\u2019t interesting\n\nDepends on the application. What you find most interesting is very individual. Some find financial markets interesting, but not other things. It could be techniques, many people find deep learning more interesting then conventional data science and thus mightn\u2019t enjoy quant work as much. So I don\u2019t think a sweeping statement here is fair.\n\n5. Stop sharing interview questions\n\nYeah I agree, but people who need to do so probably aren\u2019t going to get the job anyway.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis seems like a good example of what I usually say though. If you\u2019re here for the money, it\u2019s a shit job. There\u2019s better ways to make more. You\u2019ll end up miserable just like this person is. People who are successful and enjoy this jobs are people that like the techniques used and their theoretical components, and don\u2019t mind an application to financial markets (assuming quant research not quant trading or dev here)."

I actually don\u2019t really know what traders in buyside or S&T do.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember what a model and trading system actually are and be mindful of what they can and can\u2019t do.  The market is basically the information of the world represented in prices and transactions.  Models (at least the way MMs use them) are a way to parameterize the market into a set of variables and a trading system is how you mechanically interact with the market.  Traders are the human high touch interface between the system and the market.\n\nPretty intuitively one should recognize the market, practically speaking, more or less has like an infinite number of variables.  So a lot of the nuance of algorithmic trading is watching the bot interact with the market, and seeing/feeling which variables the market is actually trading on and how, then steer both the model(s) and the bot to react appropriately.  On top of realtime risk management this is basically what a trader does.  Automation can only happen to the extent to which your model is correctly specified wrt the market and correct specification can fade in and out.  Models come with constraints and assumptions and these can come and go in different market contexts.\n\nQRs, at least the ones who work on vol modeling, take feedback from both data and traders (who are going to have a better contextual grasp of certain states of the world than raw data) to improve how well the model is specified wrt the market and adapts in real time.  I\u2019m sure there are a ton of QRs who work on complicated unrelated stuff which I wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin explaining.  Kinda related to vol modeling, trade impact modeling for options is a huge subset.\n\nConcrete example of where this distinction matters:\n\nThe other day the options market of a high cap very liquid symbol was implying a pretty negative skew for two days despite the stock tanking the last two days.  The entire sector of this symbol was tanking alongside it but this ticker was the only one where the market was strangely running an implied negative skew and where there was a ton of active upside buyers.  This was likely due to a piece of news that was idiosyncratic to this symbol which in my opinion (plus the flow), made all the sales probably good.  However there was the risk of given the negative skew the stock gapping down could\u2019ve forced the model to lower the front vol way more dramatically than I would have liked and another MM would probably come blasting away at me given that scenerio so I cranked up the quadratic vol shock component of the model\u2019s backbone and faded my offer sizes as I got shorter upside.  It would be, imo, incredibly difficult to model and automate this thought process without heavy human intervention.",

Half-life calculations, probability of moves, unit root testing, and various aspects of time series modeling are used here.

This is one of the most mathematically intensive phase in the whole process.\n\nHypothesis testing/Hyper-parameter optimization: Establishment of a filtered mean-reverting signal commands a strategy that can convert the inefficiencies into hard PnL.

                    "Hey I interned at a market making quant firm (SIG, Optiver, IMC, Jane Street, Akuna etc.) in their sydney office (joining another one soon). Not the headquarters but still has a few hundred employees and a very big quant team. I was a trader but also worked very closely with the quant team. MM firms are quite different to quant hedge funds like DE Shaw or Two Sigma but still pay obscene amounts and the overall goal is still to make as much money as possible.\n\n>My background: I\u2019m working on creating ML models in a product team at FB, I have 1yoe, joined here as a new grad. I have a BSc from a top school in CS and Maths.\n\nI'm not sure about the hedge funds like DE Shaw or Two Sigma but in the market making space: Optiver, Jane Street, IMC etc. there is a big shift right now towards data science. MM firms especially love FAANG people. They look for people who not just know the libraries well but genuinely have a deep dive understanding of the models and the mathematics. However one YOE is not that amazing and typically most ML hires have research experience. So I'm not sure how competitive your background makes you for a QR role. But I can definitely see you landing a QDev role.\n\n>I\u2019ve been reading and playing around with algo trading. I love the problem space. I like what I\u2019m doing now, but having my models generate money directly sounds more exciting and motivating than having them increase user interaction.\n\nThis is great to hear and you should emphasise this in your interview. MM firms don't typically hire from finance backgrounds and don't need you to have any knowledge, but they nevertheless love it when you show passion for the domain. Keep in mind what you will be doing will probably be widly different from what you've read (you literally can't even google the stuff I was taught at my internship) but the fact you are showing interest in the domain makes me think you'll enjoy the job.\n\n>I think I\u2019d like the finance culture more. Again, I\u2019m quite happy where I am, but I feel like I sometimes want a more competitive, high performing, slightly cuthroat environment where I\u2019d be pushed towards my very limits and be rewarded for it. I usually thrive under pressure and not so much when everyone around is chill.\n\nQR/QDev roles are definitely quite pressured but that cutthroat pushing to limits culture only exists inside the trading teams themselves. That being said these are the sorts they look for in hires so perhaps you should apply to trading instead. Trading is a very different set of skills and knowledge. Your background will be enough to get you into the interview stage but getting through is something else.\n\n>Much higher ceiling for TC.\n\nI don't think QR/QDev roles would pay THAT much more than a dev at FB working in the silicon valley office. Traders definitely make way more though.\n\n>Based on the above, what roles would you recommend and what would it take for me to transition there? I\u2019m open to doing a Masters in maths/statistics, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be happy doing a PhD as I find academia to be slightly slow paced and boring. Is what I\u2019m looking for even possible?\n\nPHD is not compulsory for **most** firms. More than half the QR's didn't have phd's where I worked. Masters don't matter. No one cares about them. You're better off getting more experience at FB. And yes it is very possible to transition. There were a ton of FAANG guys with us. I would suggest notching up your knowledge of ML. Both from a practical and theoretical POV. Spend another year or two at FB and then apply as an experienced hire. Grad interviews are really nasty in that they can ask you really whacky brainteasers or on random mathematics like PDE's (been there, done that). You went to a top school so I'm sure it wouldn't be hard for you to get in touch with someone in the industry. Get a referal from them, it helps smoothen the process, and your interview should then be entirely about your personality and your ML knowledge. If you are really desperate to jump over ASAP, then apply as a grad but be warned you will need to do a lot of interview practice and will probably only talk in depth about ML in your final round.

Similar thing when starting a quant shop, it\u2019s a lot more compliance/legal/raising funds/starting a business type work more so than it is quant work, which may not be worth all the trouble for people.\n\n\nPersonally, a quant PM at a large HF (having your own pod especially) would be my target. You get to make the decisions and creative freedom with a lot less cursory work and downside risk.",
                    "Unless you have a team willing to start with you, it'll be extraordinarily difficult.  While the strategy piece might be part of the core of the business, to run a HF, you 100% need the following:\n\n- Experienced CCO and/or trusted legal team\n- CTO that can get the right team for your infrastructure needs; as a QT/QR, you need to worry about the research and not about keeping your backtesting systems up or your broker connections on (speaking of which, do you know the different ways to connect to your brokers/how to configure the firewalls/routers?).  You'll need to hire someone for that, likely.  Even if you have a third party provider, you don't want to be the one dealing with it when a situation inevitably happens.\n- Experienced mid-back office manager (could be managed by be CTO/CCO that doubles as COO, technically) that can handle agreements (market data, give-up, electronic trading setup whether XC/VPN/third party) and stuff like trade/position recs (even automated systems will need some human to monitor this)\n- Marketing (only HF) with significant contacts since the above+market data will cost you a fortune, and time will not be on your side\n\nThe four above only scratches the surface.  The above four must also know/have the relevant licenses/regulation and general business knowledge.  There's a LOT of paperwork in running these types of businesses.  You'll need to be concerned about the most annoying things like cyber security and other internal documentation (most memberships require some form cyber security prep such as an ISSP + solid BCP), and so forth.  New clients will require DDQs to be answered that try and poke holes in every aspect of the business (from tech to financials to strategy to legal).\n\nCertainly possible, but you'll need an experienced team, or you're certainly going to run into a minefield if problems/spend outrageous amounts on expenses.\n\n**Edit**: I left out the answer to your last question: it's _very_ different from most regular startups.  The only similarity I can really think of is the risk and general business filings.  Outside of healthcare, I'm not sure what other industry is regulated as much as the financial.\n\nIn addition to that, you have a critical dependency on some form of market data (aside from crypto).  You can't get market data from some discount place anymore because you might get audited and fined.  Your clients can't just start paying/using your products like most startups.  They often will run very in-depth due diligence on you prior to the investment.  Depending on the structure of your products/how you offer your services, you'll need to apply/maintain membership in some form (e.g. FINRA), which has a whole slew of requirements in itself regarding compliance.",

The challenges are AUM and performance.\n\nIf you can do prop trading or run a family office, life will get easier than all the headaches of managing public money. If you want lots of AUM, you become a compliance and marketing machine. \n\nPerformance challenges are the same as if you worked for someone, except you need to build out infrastructure which kind of sucks.",

I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be the same for Internships as well.\n\nThere is a lot of overlap between quant trader and quant researcher though, and where exactly the roles differ changes a bit from firm to firm. In general, a QR will build models modelling the market, economics, individual assets, trading strategies and pricing derivatives etc. QTs take this, apply to it to their individual circumstances, adapt the model and execute trades based on this.\n\nHowever, as you can see there\u2019s an overlap. How much of an input the trader has and how much leeway they have in adapting these models is very firm dependent.\n\nQT can be a good stepping stone if you want to be a QR, you can gain experience there, save up some money then continue onto further studies. Or you can skip that part and go straight into further studies instead if you so desire. Alternatively, QT is still a lucrative career and many people are happy to be QTs and not go into QR. What your final goal is is up to you, but at the moment you\u2019ll likely just get a position as a QT intern, not a QR one.

Realising you're going to be asked to give detail about it because your colleague is off, and knowing senior people will be there, you scan the other email subjects for other important stuff and then dive into the code.\n\n\nIt has 2 poor quality unit tests and calls some library for the key bit. The tests run in a few seconds, so probably aren't affected by the problem. You reread the email, spinning down to the earliest part of the conversation and see that some parameter beta is 0 in the trades the trader is trying to value. You step through the occurrences of beta in the code - one of them uses beta to choose between two different library calls, with a comment along the lines of \"this isn't great but at least it doesn't sporadically fail for beta = 0.\n\n\nNeither of the unit tests have beta equal to zero.\n\n\nYou have half an hour til the meeting, so you call a friend who used to trade this stuff and might have a clue. She is hazy on the detail too, but says something about beta being close to zero for some new class of trades.\n\n\nYou change a unit test to have a zero beta, and after 30s of waiting you kill it. You try a beta very slightly above zero. The code runs ok, but you notice a matrix determinant in the test output seems large.\n\n\nTime's up, you go to the meeting.\n\n\nAs you sit down, a quant from research says hi - you've barely met since they started during lockdown. No one else has arrived, so you take a chance and ask if he has any thoughts on how beta figures into the problem.\n\n\nHe agrees it seems like a possible issue, particularly as models were written expecting beta to be around 1, not around 0, but with Recent Events the volatility has pushed beta down.\n\n\nDuring the meeting, you voice your concern about beta, explain that it's not code you've had much interaction with and point out that with small beta, the code performs ok, with some concern about how the coefficients of one of the matrices scale. Some people nod, one of the traders mentions that there is sometimes an issue with one of the data feeds for the implied volatility going stale. Most of the actions are on you to do some limited investigation, and for the trader to send you some relevant data (I.e. the spreadsheet they were using).\n\n\nBack at your desk, you realise you have promised your boss you'd finish a piece of documentation on the work you completed last week by the end of the day. You realise you haven't had any lunch. Having promised yourself you wouldn't eat at your desk any more, you think fuck it and go to get some lunch.\n\n\nSitting on a bench by a pretty tree, you fantasize once again about how you'd replace the pricing framework with one that supported constraints based coding, and adaptive sampling techniques you've read about, or maybe polynomial decomposition stuff, because it seems like it would be both faster and more resilient, including for scenarios like today's beta problems.\n\n\nYou dither on finishing the report a bit, there's a bit you weren't quite clear about when you were writing the code, and it's hard to explain it without highlighting the gap.\n\n\nYou review a CV for a junior hire - they seem academic enough, but there's not much that suggests they can actually code, and you wonder if they might jump ship for quant research. Not that you mind, just that you don't want to get left with all the work or have to listen while they complain about it being grunt work.\n\n\nYou finish the report, and then take another stab at the code - the trader has sent you the spreadsheet and after a quick call you can see the data you need buried in one of the tabs.\n\n\nYou mess about for a while turning the data into a unit test - at first the data won't load, then you realise you were using the wrong loader configuration. You get the unit test running the appropriate data, and it does seem to be taking a long time to run.\n\n\nYou try setting beta to some low, nonzero value. The solver fails with some cryptic error, and you notice the determinant of the intermediate result matrix is bananas. It's already half an hour after you should have left, and you're supposed to be taking your girlfriend out tonight.\u00a0\n\n\nYou think \"fuck it\", and\u00a0go home.",

It\u2019s a learning experience and you can learn a lot from it. \n\nHiring for any position is about answering three questions: \n- \u201cCan the candidate do the job?\u201d \n- \u201cDoes the candidate want the job?\u201d \n- \u201cWill the candidate get along with the team?\u201d \n\nYour interviews/screenings will generally fall into one of these three categories. Some companies for better and for worse want to see how you react to pressure. Take that also as a signal for what kind of expectations the firm has for your performance.\n\nLastly, saying \u201cyou don\u2019t need to know anything about finance\u201d is a bit of hyperbole. The reality with any of these roles is you need to know more than you need to know. You can now prepare a better response for yourself. \u201cI never expect to know everything that means I\u2019m coming in humble and hungry. I\u2019m excited to learn and I am bringing a capable technical skill set.\u201d\n\nEdit: one more thought, feel free to do some homework/prep leading up to the interview on the firm, industry, and interviewer. During the interview get a sense whether or not you want to work with these people/industry/firm too.",
                    "It's kind of expected, depends on the role and place but you should be able to demonstrate interest in the markets and trading. When we interview PhD in physics or maths at my place the two things that make them fail the most are: lack of experience/interest in coding (the majority of them) and/or lack of interest in trading. Basically we get a lot of people thinking they're gonna do the job of a domain agnostic data scientist, which is really not what quant trading is.",

                    "Really depends on the interviewer and team. Trading roles are far from being rocket science, and some firms/teams will prefer demonstrated interest in the field over a better understanding of theoretical mathematics. It's more commonly the research roles that prioritize pure quantitative abilities over any demonstrated interest in the market.",
                    "To be honest, he probably wasn't looking for any real insight from you but perhaps whether or not you have _any_ contextual knowledge. Sure, if you were applying for a back-office software eng job I'd be quite surprised by this. But if you applied for a front-office quant research / trading role then some minimal contextual knowledge of markets at least shows you have some enthusiasm for working in finance. Just guessing - I think it's unreasonable to expect a trading / quant interview to occur without touching upon any finance. Combine that with an interviewer who may have been in a bad mood = disaster."
