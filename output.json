Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",
                    "What is going on??? Is there no-one that can see, AND put an end to these Bastards. They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Put it all together and you have the complete package of a human.                                                                   Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",

Are they holding the Govt and the US public to ransom through their control of the treasury, banks and financial system?? This is NOT what is expected of intelligent, reasonable, moral, ethical people with even a modicum of common sense. So it appears that it is the work of the Jewish Elite, aka the Jewish Mafia. They have to go!!!",

They are openly threatening us, and with such conviction as to suggest they are now in control of the Govt. And because they are not human they do not have any human empathy or emotional structure to be considered human.

Anything not conforming to this metric, yet LOOKS like a human, is a human with faults and flaws. These Jewish Elite are such entities, I say entities, because they are not normal healthy humans, they are human, but with severe mental and emotional defects.                                 They are a unique breed and species with no (or very little) connection or relationship to what I call \"normal\" Jews, meaning the greater majority of the Jews are seemingly good people. They can relate and even assimilate. Not all mind you, because the Jews are taught that the white man is shit and that we should all be dead, so you can see that being associated with anyone other than Jews raises the ire and derision of these bastards and other Jews as well.",
